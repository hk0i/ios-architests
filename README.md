#iOS ArchiTests
This project is a set of small test projects to perform experimental work in Objective-C, trying to find ways to apply more abstract, loosely coupled, **SOLID** designs.

While I may not be an expert architect *yet*, the focus is to experiment. Some of the stuff here will be shear genius, but mostly it will be me trying to reach a better understanding of how to write better, more maintainable iOS code.

It is mostly an effort to unclutter the `UIViewController`s and sort of break the mold by providing examples of alternate code implementation methodologies.

I will update this file later with resources (articles) that have inspired me and where I derived my ideas from.

For now you get a very *very* unorganized, list:

* [Architecting iOS Apps with VIPER][]
* [Presentation Model][] (this is the article the [MVVM](mvvm/) project is based on), but originally spotted at [objc.io's Introduction to MVVM][]
